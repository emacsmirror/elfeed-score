  # Per
  # <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request>:
  # "if no activity types are specified, the workflow runs when a pull
  # request is opened or reopened or when the head branch of the pull
  # request is updated." That said, I've had difficulty getting workflows to trigger on PRs.

    types: [opened, edited, reopened] # don't say `synchronize`-- that is taken care of by `push`
